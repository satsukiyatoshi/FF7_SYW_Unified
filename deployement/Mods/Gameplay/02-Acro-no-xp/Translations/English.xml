This is a hard game mode.    

Enemies don't grant experience, which means your characters never level up.
The game won't be much harder in the beginning but the further you go, the harder it will be, it will even be very difficult at the end without a good strategy.

I recommend this setting if you know the game and the enemies almost by heart.

It is compatible with all versions of FF7 but some combat elements will be in French only.</help>
