This is a hard game mode.    

Enemies don't grant experience points, which means your characters never level up.

The game won't be much harder at the beginning, but the further you get, the harder it will be. In the end, without a good strategy, it becomes very difficult.

This mod is recommended if you know the game and the enemies almost by heart.

It is compatible with all versions of FF7 but some combat elements will be in French only.
