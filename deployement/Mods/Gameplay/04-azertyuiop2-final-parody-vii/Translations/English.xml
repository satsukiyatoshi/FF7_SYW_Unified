		<help>Final Parody VII: 
		
This project has no other goal than to offer a unique humorous experience based on the official game and the retranslation of Neo-Midgar (in French only).
 
The patch parodies most of the game's text: 
Dialogues, menus, texts in battles and on the world map, default names of characters and places, materia names, etc.

It is recommended to use the soundtrack remixed by its author for this mod (in audio mods).

It is compatible with all versions of FF7 but the game will be 100% in French.
