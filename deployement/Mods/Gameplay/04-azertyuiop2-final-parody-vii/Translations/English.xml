		<help>Final Parody VII : 
		
This project has no other goal than to offer a unique humorous experience based on the official game and the Neo-Midgar retranslation.
 
The patch parodies most of the game's text : 
dialogues, menus, texts in combat and on the world map, default names of characters and places, materia names, etc.

We recommand using the soundtrack remixed by its author (in the music pack menu).

It is compatible with all versions of FF7 but the game will be 100% in French.</help>
