Text/Dialogue Revision v2
*) The dialogue in the game has been revised.
*) Additional dialogue events have been added.
*) Disclaimer: The text/dialogue revision is NOT a re-translation/localisation of the Japanese text.


Items & Shops
*) All item placements have been revised.
Additional pickups have been hidden throughout the field maps.
*) Shop Inventories & Prices have been adjusted, most shops have a new item/Materia for sale.


Extended Save Points
*) Save Points have some additional options attached to them, accessed through a hotkey (Square/Switch).
This opens a menu from which various options can be selected. Note that the Encounter Toggle from 1.5 has been retired
in favour of giving the player a maxed Enemy Away Materia once they leave Kalm; this gives a heavily reduced encounter
rate that can be toggled at will, and works on the World Map where the old Encounter Toggle did not.

Hotkeys
) Square/Switch: Open the Extended Options menu

Options:
) Keep Field Music for Battles
) Source Point Upgrade
) Hard Mode Toggle (triggers a special enemy encounter to change the in-battle variable)
) 0 EXP Toggle
) Return to Highwind (North Crater and certain other locations only)



Talk to Party In Towns
*) When visiting towns, you can find the main characters hanging around the place similar to how they would during the
initial Costa Del Sol visit, or when gathering people for Bugenhagen's Observatory show. Their dialogue changes as
the story progresses; characters recruited later in the story will appear in earlier towns as well, if revisited.
Typically the dialogue changes from Disc 1 to Disc 2 then once more to Disc 3.

Affected Towns:
*) Kalm
*) Chocobo Ranch
*) Under Junon
*) Costa Del Sol
*) Cosmo Canyon
*) Forgotten City
*) Icicle Inn
*) Midgar



Scenes
*) Some disabled or deleted scenes have been restored
*) New optional scenes were added
*) Revised Scenes, some of the original scenes were given tweaks to audio, animation, etc.
*) Flashback/Memory scenes can be skipped using in-character dialogue options:
	Jessie's Plate Explanation on the Train
	Promise at the Well Flashback
	Nibelheim Flashback
	Corel Flashback (1st)
	Rocket Launch Flashback
	Cloud's Memory scene in Mideel
	


New Materia & 'Splinter' Materia
*) Some new Materia was added to handle new spells added to the game.

Certain spells which would be desirable to combo with Support Materia are blocked from this when the Materia levels up
and the next spell is unlocked. Splinter Materia are single-spell Materia to allow for these spells to be used in combos
without having to replace them when the Materia levels up. Some commands have also been moved onto their own Materia.

New Materia
) Omni-Plus
) Hydro
) Pearl
) Osmose
) X-Attack
) Flash
) Core

Splinter Materia
) Regen
) Slow
) Dispel
) MBarrier
) Reflect
) Break
) Tornado



Bugfixes, QoL Additions, and Misc.
*) Thief enemies can now only steal gil, not items, from the party.

*) Counter attacks from enemies have [Counter] appended to their name (where possible)
Exceptions include player-available spells as these names come from the kernel and attacks
where an attack name is not shown during the animation.

*) Shop inventories have been adjusted for better availability of certain items.

*) Source Upgrade flow was improved so that specific characters can be selected for upgrade rather than
having to upgrade them in order.

*) Source Upgrades are now given at fixed points after defeating certain bosses, rather than accrued as a currency.
They can be applied at any time (or not at all) from Save Points.

*) Player gets access to a modified Enemy Away Materia that can reduce enemy encounter rate to near-zero on
both fields and the world map (replaces Encounter Toggle on older builds).

*) The prices of certain progress-requirements have been adjusted.

*) The CPR Minigame can be finished within a single button-press.

*) In Battle Square, you keep BP when leaving the area and can check what the prizes are with 0 BP.
Stipulation: Whenever the prizes are changed, BP is reduced to 25% of what you had.
This will occur after getting the Highwind and then again when entering Disc 3.

*) A fixed bonus of BP is given for completing 8 rounds in Battle Square, so even bad reels will still afford the
player a decent amount of BP.

*) 3D Battler, an RNG problem where the player had a less than 1% chance of winning all 5 rounds and not terminating
correctly after Round 5 (resulting in an invisible opponent and a potential softlock) have both been fixed. GP given
was adjusted. Players have roughly 50% chance of winning all rounds (with a 90+% chance of winning the first round).
A trophy Key Item can be acquired for clearing all rounds.

*) A trophy Key Item can be acquired by beating the Snowboard Crazy Course with 100/100 points.

*) The GP Seller in the Gold Saucer will always appear.

*) The lever in Yuffie's House in Wutai has been altered to be easier to use.
In vanilla, this uses a set-up that is unreliable so it has been adjusted to be easier to activate.

*) Temple of the Ancients: The Clock Puzzle can now be 'skipped' while keeping all items/routes available.
When initially visiting the Clock room, the 'guardian' will ask you if you want to proceed as normal with controlling
the clock or to skip it instead. If the Skip option is picked, then all rooms except #12 will be made accessible at all
times. The arena room can still be reached by standing on any of the hands and letting the 'seconds' hand touch the player.

*) Retry Battle events have been added to some boss battles where a lengthy cutscene plays beforehand.

*) An audio-synch issue was adjusted for an FMV toward the end of Disc 1.

*) Various Disc 2 Scenes were tweaked for better stage direction and character involvement.
For example, a character will turn their head to look at the person speaking instead of being left staring into space
from their last set of stage direction commands. Another example, in Mideel all characters have been set to respond rather
than a priority system that leaves the 2nd character passive (and locks off Vincent's dialogue altogether as he's last in the list).

*) In the Schizo area, the 'cannot escape from battle' flag is cleared after the battle so that random encounters can be escaped.

*) In Ancient Forest, the game asks for confirmation before returning the player to the start if Square/Switch is pressed.

*) The music cue for a scene in Cloud's Memory has been corrected.

*) Chocobo shading has been improved for the Choboco Ranch when viewing Chocobos in a menu.

*) Save Points have been placed throughout the North Crater and all have a Teleport to Highwind option.

*) It is now possible to backtrack onto any of the three routes in the North Crater from the bottom, rather than having to use
the Left-Down path in order to enter the Right & Left-Up paths again.

*) Magic Pots drop an Elixir when defeated, meaning the player does not lose Elixirs when farming for AP.

*) Opportunities to save the game during the final bosses have been added; the Bizarro Save has been moved to within the scene
prior to battle set-up rather than before the beginning of the scene itself.

*) You can now collect the full set of 12 '1/35 Soldier' items.
