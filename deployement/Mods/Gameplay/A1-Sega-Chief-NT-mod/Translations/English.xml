		<help>NT mod:
		
This mod is a complete overhaul of the FF7 game system.
  
Third-party 3D models (modern, or additional textures) are not recommended, they may cause bugs.
The overall scenario is the same but there are many changes, side quests, new enemies... this mod is difficult to describe because it changes the game in depth.

I recommend this mod if you have already done FF7 at least once and you are an English speaker.

It is compatible with all versions of FF7 but the game will be 100% in English.
