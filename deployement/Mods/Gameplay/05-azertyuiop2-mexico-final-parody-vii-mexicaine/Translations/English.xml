		<help>Final Parody VII Mexican: 
		
This project is the parodic mode of azertyuiop2 to which we added the difficulty of the hard mode of mexico.

So it offers a unique humorous experience based on the official game and the retranslation of Neo-Midgar (in French only) while being very difficult.

The patch parodies most of the game's text:  
Dialogues, menus, texts in battles and on the world map, default names of characters and places, materia names, etc.

The enemies are much more powerful than those of the original game. The attacks and abilities of the enemies have been changed and do not have the same effects.

It is recommended to use the soundtrack remixed by its author for this mod (in audio mods).

It is compatible with all versions of FF7 but the game will be 100% in French.</help>
