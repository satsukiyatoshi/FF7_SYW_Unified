		<help>Final Parody VII Mexican : 
		
this project is the parodic mode of azertyuiop2 to which we add the difficulty of the hard mode of mexico.

So it offers a unique humorous experience based on the official game and the Neo-Midgar translation (in French only) while being very difficult.
The patch parodies most of the game's text :  dialogues, menus, text in combat and on the world map, default character and location names, materia names, etc.

The enemies are much more powerful than those of the original game.
The attacks and abilities of the enemies have been changed and do not have the same effects.

we recommend using the soundtrack remixed by its author (in the music pack menu).

It is compatible with all versions of FF7 but the game will be 100% in French.</help>
