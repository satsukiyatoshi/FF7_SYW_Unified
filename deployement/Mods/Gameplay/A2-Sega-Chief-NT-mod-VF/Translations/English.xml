		<help>New Threat mod (French version, v2.09998): 

This mod is a quick french translation of the original "New Threat mod", it's based on an old "New Threat mod".

It is recommended to use the official "New Threat mod" if you can read english.

"New Threat mod":		
This mod is a complete overhaul of the FF7 game system.
  
Third-party 3D models (modern, or additional textures) are not recommended, they may cause bugs.

The overall scenario is the same but there are many changes, side quests, new enemies,... 

This mod is difficult to describe because it changes the game in depth.

This mod is recommended if you have already played through FF7 at least once and speak English.

It is compatible with all versions of FF7 but the game will be 100% in English.
