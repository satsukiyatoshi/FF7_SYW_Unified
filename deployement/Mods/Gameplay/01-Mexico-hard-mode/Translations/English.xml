		<help>Hard mod:
		
This is a hard game mode.

The enemies are much more powerful than those of the original game.
The attacks and abilities of the enemies have been changed and do not have the same effects.

I recommend this setting if you want a real challenge because the fights no longer have the same logic, it's almost a different game.

You can use this mod with all FF7 languages but only French and English translations are available.
Some texts will be in English for unsupported languages.</help>
