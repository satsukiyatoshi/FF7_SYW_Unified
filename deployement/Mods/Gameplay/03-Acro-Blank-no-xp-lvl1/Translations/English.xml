This is a very difficult game mode.

Enemies don't grant experience points, which means that the level of your characters never increases, but in addition the characters will be at level 1.

The game will be harder from the beginning, but the further you get, the harder it will be, bordering on impossible.

This mod is recommended if you know the game and the enemies by heart, if you like ability charts and intensive strategies, or if you are crazy.

It is compatible with all versions of FF7 but some combat elements will be in French only.
