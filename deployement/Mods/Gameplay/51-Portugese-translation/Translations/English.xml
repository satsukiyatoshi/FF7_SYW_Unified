		<text>Italian ReTranslation (v1.62)</text>
		<help>This project's goal is to retranslate FF7 into Italian using Daniel Burke's Reunion as the English source for the dialogues, while constantly cross-checking with the original Japanese script.

For non-dialogue terms Caledor have been reusing official translations as much as possible.

The goal is not to have a localization that looks only to FF7 as a stand-alone game, Caledor want it to blend well with the other Final Fantasy games that already exists in Italian.

It's hightly recommended to use HD textures with this mod.

As this translation is based on english's game version, you MUST choose english as game language in the left menu or it'll wont work as intended
