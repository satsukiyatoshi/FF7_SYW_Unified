        <help>Multi-linked slots (vanilla):

Manipulate the slot connections of all weapons and armor for new materia combinations.

Typically you are limited to the linked slots A+B, C+D, E+F, and G+H. With this mod you can create link combinations like A+B+C, D+E+F, and G+H. This means that B can be linked to two separate materias without the need to use an additional copy of B.

Note that simply activating additional linkings does not make any changes to the equipment. For this reason, this mod includes a modified kernel, which limits this mod to vanilla gameplay.
