		<help>Battle true wait :

This mod adjusts the ATB system to wait for commands and animations so the urgent imput of commands is not necessary anymore (more relaxing battles)

Note that a character with twice as much speed as another character will take twice as many actions, rather than the speed difference being lost during animations like it is in vanilla

Note that this mod is making it way harder to run away from enemies compared to vanilla
