		<help>Cosmo Memory with battle voices (v1.1): 
		
Replaces in-game sound effects with a modernized version, including those in menus.

In battles, character attacks also feature grunts vocal sounds.

Can change the mood on some sequences.

If you enable footsteps in the driver, these sounds will also be adapted to the type of ground surface.
