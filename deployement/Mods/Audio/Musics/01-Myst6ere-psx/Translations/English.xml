		<help>FFNx FF7Music: 
		
This music is that of the original PSX game (and therefore much better than the original PC version).

The files are based on the exact files used by the PSX, so the representation is identical.

Ideal for those who want good rendering like on PSX. This mod represents the best possible rendering for the original music.
