Considering their poor quality, the original videos of the game are not in this pack.

The videos have been increased to 30fps instead of 15fps and upscaled directly from the psx version.

It's not 100% perfect but it's the best compromise to have fluid videos of sufficient quality not to break the immersion in the game.</help>
