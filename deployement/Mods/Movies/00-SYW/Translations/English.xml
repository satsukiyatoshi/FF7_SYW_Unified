		<help>HD videos 30 fps: 
		
Due to their poor quality, the game's original videos are not included in this package.

The base material comes directly from the PSX version and has been increased from 15 fps to 30 fps and upscaled.

The result is not 100% perfect, but it is the best compromise to have smooth videos of sufficient quality that do not affect the immersion in the game.
